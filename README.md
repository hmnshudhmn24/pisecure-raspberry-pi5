# üîí PiSecure - Face & Voice Recognition Door Unlock System (Raspberry Pi 5)

PiSecure is an AI-powered security system built for Raspberry Pi 5 that combines facial recognition and voice authentication to unlock a door. It's a smart, touchless, and secure solution for your personal or office space.

## üí° Features

- Face recognition using OpenCV + face_recognition
- Voice recognition with speech-to-text (Google Speech API)
- Flask web UI to initiate authentication
- Text-to-speech feedback using pyttsx3
- Camera and microphone integration
- Real-time access decision with detailed status

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (Dlib)
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3 (TTS)
- Flask

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Pi Camera or USB webcam
- Microphone
- Door actuator or relay module (for actual unlocking)
- Speaker (for voice feedback)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-opencv libatlas-base-dev portaudio19-dev
pip3 install flask face_recognition opencv-python pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition
```

### 2. Add Your Face

Place a clear image of your face in `known_faces/user.jpg`. This image will be used for recognition.

### 3. Set Voice Password

In `app.py`, change:

```python
VOICE_PASSWORD = "open sesame"
```

To your preferred passphrase.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
python3 app.py
```

Access the dashboard at `http://<your_pi_ip>:5050` and press "Unlock Door".

## üîê How it Works

1. Face is scanned using webcam.
2. If matched, system prompts for voice.
3. If voice is verified, door is unlocked.
4. TTS feedback is provided throughout.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure lighting is decent for camera accuracy.
- Ensure microphone is configured properly.
- You can connect the final output to a GPIO pin to control a relay for unlocking.
